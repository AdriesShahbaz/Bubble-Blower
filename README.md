# Bubble-Blower
Design project (never built) to design and build an automatic bubble blowing machine

I am designing a bubble blowing machine that is able to track a target and fire bubbles at it. I decided to choose a design that has wheels and is able to be driven by the user using a remote and an infrared detector. One button on the remote will lower the wand to collect bubbles and turn on a motor to blow the bubbles. This is the shooting mechanic. The idea is for the user to chase the target using the driving controls and fire at them, similarly to a tank

Parts List:
- L293D chip
- 90Â° Servo motor
- Three DC Motors
- Fan
- NPN Transistor
- Two Wheels
- IR reciver
- IR remote
